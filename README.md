# DWM3000-ATMega328p
Porting DWM3000 C code library to work with ATMEGA328P

The uploaded code is a Microchip Studio project!

The library port currently uses the DWS3000 arduino shield attached to an Arduino Uno!

It is able to communicate to the DWM3000 module over SPI and have simple TX and RX transmissions occur sucessfully. Unfortunately, the TWR-responder and TWR-initiator examples are not currently working...
